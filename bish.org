#+TITLE: Bish
** General explanation of bish the bioshell.
Before we begin, lets start with a few points to help prevent any confusion regarding bish.

*** A list of things which bish is:
**** Bish is a shell script loader.
   If it was in your config yesterday, it should still be there today.
**** Bish is modular.
   Bish itself is a single small module which holds all the other pieces together like glue.
**** Bish is extensible.
   Simply add an entry to your BISH_CONFIG and ensure the script is sourced, so bish knows to include it.
**** Bish is portable.
   The entire reason it exists is because I got tired of trying to reproduce my environment across multiple machines.
**** Bish is declarative.
   So you can focus on what functionality to include in your configuration rather than focusing on ensuring it's included.
**** Bish is self modifying.
   While self modifying code can be painful to work with in some circumstances, this implementation makes it easy to see
   what has occured in each step of the process. The ability to self modify and include new functionality as part of its source
   is what makes it both powerful and portable.
**** Bish is a quine.
   I could say something like "It's a feature for debuging" but the real reason is that quines are cool.

*** A list of things which bish isn't:
**** Bish is not fully documented.
   (Perhaps you can help).
**** Bish is not limited to the field of Bioinformatics.
   This is just the use case which spawned it's existence.
**** Bish is not a replacement for your package managers.
   It can however, play quite nicely with them.

* Bish config
The bish config. Possibly the single most important aspect of the bish environment.
If all goes well the majority of your time interacting with bish should be tinkering with this config.
Hopefully this is as human readable and straightforward as possible so that shouldn't be much time at all.
(If you can think of ways to improve it let us know)
** Begin config
The bish config could be it's own file but it's easier to make it portable if it gets lumped in with the rest of the shell script.
Then you only have a single file to worry about.
#+begin_src sh :tangle bish.sh
BISH_CONFIG="$(cat << EOF
#+end_src
** Global scope variables
Next we have some config varibles to let bish know a bit about how you want to use your system.
We have tried to avoid hard coding as much as possible.
We do still however include what we think are some sensible defaults.
#+begin_src sh :tangle bish.sh
[bash]
rc_path = "$HOME/repos/me/dotfiles/.bashrc"

[bish]
home = "$HOME/.config/bish"

[zsh]
rc_path = "$HOME/repos/me/dotfiles/.zshrc"
#+end_src
** genes
These genes let bish know all the things it should know how to do.
Assuming that all the functions you want are referenced here (And sourced at the time of replication), all future replications will contain that code.
If the code isn't sourced and the remote has been defined, bish can even try to fetch it for you.
Just be careful that you know what is being fetched.
If you tell bish to fetch and load malicious code, it will load it.
With great power, comes great responsibility.
*** bish genes
Even bish's core features don't need to be set in stone.
We recommend that you don't change it for compatibility reasons, but it's your config after all.

*** Bliss genes
This is not currently used directly by bish but is still neat.
We are working toward releasing a Verizon of bish which allows you to extend functionality using a lisp/shell hybrid, not just plain shell script, without impacting portability.
This is essentially just a modified version of the bash MAL/Fleck which had been tailored to this task.
Big thanks to the MAL (Make a lisp) project and Fleck (bash MAL makefile) project for the time save here.

*** system repos
Defining the repos info over and over for each system would be quite tedious.
Instead we can define the repo info once here allowing it to be referenced in many places.

** TODO layers
You do not need to load all genes (features) at once and doing so for large configs could slow things down.
layers will be used to conditionally load /disable functionality and avoid loading it when it's not needed.
This is not fully implemented yet but should be quite useful going forwards.
Watch this space!

** State
This is a part of the bish configuration which can be used to store persistent internal state.
This will be more useful once the toml gene is updated to be able to set/update, not just read.
In the meantime this can still be set/updated manually through other means.
#+begin_src sh :tangle bish.sh
# You should not need to touch this.
[state]
    layer="normal"
#+end_src
** End config
Remember, we are in a shell script so it's important that we ensure the config ends before the code starts.

* bish
Here is the source for the bish itself, as you can see it is rather small.
I would probably not change this too much or you could cause compatibility issues with newer, more featured versions of bish.
If you do implement a core feature you just cannot live without and think others may agree, consider submitting a pull request.

Current Ideas:
- Introduce something like shellcheck when mutating to avoid pulling in smelly code.
